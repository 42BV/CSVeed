/**
 * <p>
 * This package contains what remains of the Spring Beans package after the operation to remove Spring from the library.
 * The aspects concern the conversion from a String to a Bean property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you find good in this package, give credits to the Spring team. If you find bad, I probably made a mistake
 * somewhere. Removing the Spring dependency leaves me with a heavy heart, but a small library cannot afford a heavy
 * (possibly interfering) dependency like Spring and still expect to be used.
