/**
* <p>This package contains what remains of the Spring Beans package after the operation to remove Spring
* from the library. The aspects concern the conversion from a String to a Bean property.</p>
*
* <p>If you find good in this package, give credits to the Spring team. If you find bad, I probably made
* a mistake somewhere. Removing the Spring dependency leaves me with a heavy heart, but a small library
* cannot afford a heavy (possibly interfering) dependency like Spring and still expect to be used.</p>
